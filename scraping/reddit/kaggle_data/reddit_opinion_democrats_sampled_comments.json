I\u2019m only paying any attention to it at all to dance on its corpse to taunt you.\n\nGod existed before the patriarchy and God lives on after its demise.  Your contempt for what you see as \u201cfeminine faith\u201d is your contempt for the risen Christ and your love for the corpse of the patriarchy (which weak men have clung to throughout the millennium).  Patriarchy has misled you.  Turn your back on it and turn toward Christ.  There\u2019s still time.  God is faithful even when we fall away and chase after idols."

There is no question that it is a war of attrition, and that it comes out of desperation. But that desperation clearly *exists* in this case; railroad workers are willing to risk federal violence to resist the rail barons and earn the right to dignity at work. Who are you to take that right from them? What right do the millionaire business owners and landlords that make up our Congress have to take it from them?\n\nStrikes *do* have the power to improve conditions; strikes built our now-diminishing workplace rights. Successful strikes enshrine important contract protections that are much harder to erase in subsequent contracts. Successful strikes build worker solidarity and strengthen subsequent bargaining teams. I have seen this happen; I have seen how contract protections grow cycle after cycle when an engaged and mobilized membership uses their labor power. With no disrespect to your father, who undoubtedly organized in a very different environment, that kind of doomerism and lack of historical and material awareness is what led to a collaborationist and enervated labor movement in the first place. Strikes can fail, but without a strike there is no chance of success in the first place in the vast majority of negotiations.\n\nAhistorical understandings of past strikes aside (believe it or not the longshoremen's union of New York still exists and still moves major cargo, and their history and the history of US shipping is far more complicated than that; take as a counterpoint the relatively huge power of the ILWU on the west coast), the idea that the US rail industry, which made $22B *in pure profit* last year alone and which moves 1/3 of freight in this country, is going to fold over this is bananas.\n\nThe labor movement needs to recognize, especially after this, that we have no allies in power protecting us. Not anymore. At best we are a pawn used by politicians, all of whom are owned by our bosses, to gain momentary leverage over one another. Our only power is our labor power, and we *must* exercise it."

The National Republican Senatorial Committee distributed a memo encouraging GOP candidates to be [the compassionate consensus builder on abortion policy].  Republicans, If you want to be compassionate, tell your Republican friends not to pass laws that make no exception for rape or incest. And other extremist laws like charging a woman with murder.  You have really gone off the rails.  And no talking point about being compassionate will change that.  While conservative evangelicals will look at this as a moral victory, fundamentalism is not about religion. It\u2019s about power.  Whether you have rights should not depend on whether you live in a red state or a blue state.  Put that in your talking points."

Personally, I will always side with the students.\n\nYep. The purpose of NATO is to maintain US hegemony at the expense of the sovereignty of other member states."
