Sure, maybe we *could* do it, *if* we got *everyone* on board, or at least a huge majority. But that simply isn't in the cards. It's a political impossibility. You could spend your whole life living sustainably, preaching the green to anyone who will listen, doing everything in your power to lessen the ecological impact of your life and those around you and promote the healing of the planet.\n\nAll of it would be effectively undone by one average random dude living his life. He wouldn't even need to be egregious or especially bad - just an ordinary normal life, and he cancels out everything you've done, every sacrifice you've made, without even meaning to. \n\nIndividual consumption is a complete waste of time and effort. It is entirely useless, very little more than grandstanding that allows one to feel a sense of moral superiority. The *only* action that matters is stopping things at the root of the issue, at the source, and that is our economy and the corporations that control it. Anything short of that is mere performance. Corporations don't need to be held to account, they need to be physically eliminated, with extreme prejudice. So long as we continue to bleat our lines about personal responsibility and individual consumption, they continue to win, because they're setting us upon a battle field that we cannot win. Think about it - if yelping about individual responsibility actually changed anything at all, so you honestly think that they would be telling us to do so?"

Because different models can lead to divergent conclusions about marine futures, we present an integrated global ocean assessment of climate change impacts using an ensemble of multiple climate and ecosystem models. It reveals that global marine animal biomass will decline under all emission scenarios, driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production. Notably, climate change impacts are amplified at higher food web levels compared with phytoplankton. Our ensemble projections provide the most comprehensive outlook on potential climate-driven ecological changes in the global ocean to date and can inform adaptive management and conservation of marine resources under climate change.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWhile the physical dimensions of climate change are now routinely assessed through multimodel intercomparisons, projected impacts on the global ocean ecosystem generally rely on individual models with a specific set of assumptions. To address these single-model limitations, we present standardized ensemble projections from six global marine ecosystem models forced with two Earth system models and four emission scenarios with and without fishing. We derive average biomass trends and associated uncertainties across the marine food web. Without fishing, mean global animal biomass decreased by 5% (\u00b14% SD) under low emissions and 17% (\u00b111% SD) under high emissions by 2100, with an average 5% decline for every 1 \u00b0C of warming. Projected biomass declines were primarily driven by increasing temperature and decreasing primary production, and were more pronounced at higher trophic levels, a process known as trophic amplification. Fishing did not substantially alter the effects of climate change. Considerable regional variation featured strong biomass increases at high latitudes and decreases at middle to low latitudes, with good model agreement on the direction of change but variable magnitude. Uncertainties due to variations in marine ecosystem and Earth system models were similar. Ensemble projections performed well compared with empirical data, emphasizing the benefits of multimodel inference to project future outcomes. Our results indicate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that these impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels. Next steps for model development include dynamic scenarios of fishing, cumulative human impacts, and the effects of management measures on future ocean biomass trends."

        "self_text": "Bunch of good things in this thread and a bunch of ... not perse relevant stuff. I'll try to unpack the two most important factors you need to understand to get to the answer you're looking for.\n\nWhilst there are many factors influencing temperature on a planet in the solar system, the single most important one is due to *radiative forcing* that exists because some planets have an atmosphere. Planets (or moons) without an atmosphere are freezing because all the sunlight they get is radiated as warmth back into space. Our atmosphere, however traps this radiated warmth and keeps us in a cosy safe temperature range for carbon based life to exist. \n\nSome examples: Venus has a strong atmosphere and very warm temperatures. Mars on the other hand has a very thin atmosphere and the temperatures are way lower even than Earth's. The atmosphere matters way more than the relative distance to the sun, again, because it is really about how efficiently the suns energy is trapped (a lot of variety between planets) versus how much of the suns rays reach a planet (not that much difference between the planets). \n[Source: planet temperatures.](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/eoc/special_topics/teach/sp_climate_change/p_planet_temp.html) [Source: planet amospheres.](https://www.britannica.com/science/atmosphere/The-atmospheres-of-other-planets)\n\nOur next part to unpack is what in this atmosphere has the greatest effect on the radiative forcing (or blanket effect) of our Earth's atmosphere. Gases make up our atmosphere, but the one gas that contributes most to the blanket effect is Carbon Dioxide, or CO_2 (the 2 is supposed to be subscript but im not reddit savvy enough to figure that out).\n\nThere are other so called greenhouse gases like CO_2 that contribute to the greenhouse or blanket effect, like methane which is 25x more potent than carbon dioxide  or nitrous oxide or the fluorogases, but they end up contributing just a fraction to the total warming because there is so little of them compared to carbon dioxide. [Source: Climate forcing contribution](https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-climate-forcing)\n\nThe last part to this puzzle is whether the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are a result of human societies activity (we call those *anthropogenic emissions* or because of natural emissions from processes that humans take no part in. And that has a clear and unequivocal answer: Humans are by far the most important driver of carbon emissions. Even if you correct for natural cycles, periodic fluctuations, etc. And nore inportantly, the insanely quick rise of those emissions in the relatively short period of the industrial revolution where fossil fuels (the main source of our carbon emissions) are by far the most rapid and alarming changes that have been recorded in history.\n[Source: anthropogenic emissions](https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Anthropogenic_carbon_emissions) [Source: History of carbon dioxide concentration](https://earth.org/data_visualization/a-brief-history-of-co2/)\n\nLet me know if anything is unclear"

The risk is always there. All relationships are about choices.
