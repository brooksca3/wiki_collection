Specifically shit like this:\n\n*And whatever the outcome, the fateful step of bringing charges against a former president based on his conduct in office could unleash a dangerous cycle of tit-for-tat political prosecutions and revenge prosecutions. This is the stuff of banana republics, not the American system of justice.*\n\nSorry, but this whole line of thinking is fucking bullshit. Nobody is supposed to be above the law, period. There should be ZERO trepidation about prosecuting a former President for CRIMES they committed in office, for the fucking obvious reason that OTHERWISE YOU CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR PRESIDENTS TO COMMIT CRIMES WITH IMPUNITY. Which is what we now have. Prosecuting former leaders for actual crimes they committed is not the \"stuff of banana republics\" either, it's the stuff of [major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_and_allegations_involving_Silvio_Berlusconi), [developed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/world/middleeast/netanyahu-corruption-indicted.html) [democracies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37966494) that respect the rule of law. Making the President immune from prosecution - that is some banana republic bullshit, not the other way around. I hate, hate hate everything about this column. Fuck off. I don't care if it leads to tit-for-tat prosecutions by bullshit Republicans, they're already doing stuff like that anyway. And I don't care if a huge percentage of the population \"doesn't accept\" the outcome, if the outcome is correct. We can deal with that as it comes. What we don't do is be too clever by half and preemptively decide to let corruption and criminality happen in government because Republicans would complain otherwise. Fuck everything this lady said. Fuck."

And the risks are\n\nA) Turn the right into martyrs\n\nB) Provoke a backlash in general\n\nC) Entrench those officials in their own beliefs as is.\n\nMy big issue is that there's no limiting principle on this once you start harassing public officials and not protesting their general actions. Should resturants exclude them? Grocery stores? Dry cleaners? Bowling alleys?\nFor the protesters, the goal seems to be to shut them out of public life completely, which I think would only fracture our society politically even more."

If I can say one thing about Republicans it's that they fall in line and the last 6 years has continually tested that and they are still hitting their goals despite the Democratic majority while the Dems have come up short comparatively. Maybe at some point it will become too much for enough of them that they will turn on them, but think we'll be waiting in vain if the plan is to wait for some sort of moral upheaval from within to curb their trajectory. I think that if anything is going to derail them it's going to come from some someone like Desantis or Cotton getting ambitious and challenging the hierarchy prematurely causing an internal conflict. Honestly if Biden and the DNC leadership came out strongly and consistently in support of federal weed legalization and some type of meaningful corruption reform they could get a lot of people excited. They don't even have to actually do it, but just get people excited about something and that could be enough to get us through this midterm. Or we can continue to support dubious quasi-democrats who are going to hamstring the agenda for the second half of Biden's term and go into the presidential election completely deflated."

Polling is an incredibly potent tool in manipulating the perspective of prospective or on-the-fence voters, and finding unbiased polls on topics like these are incredibly difficult to find. \n\nTraditionally the most blue areas of any state are the highly populated urban areas, which also happen to be the most diverse, so claiming that these areas are suddenly being bolstered with Trump-supporting converts is just hard to believe. Not saying it's impossible, but being in a fairly diverse area of an otherwise conservative state, I have found no substantial republican support from any non-white people or communities.\n\nEdited for spelling"

That gives 10 weeks to alert the father, make a decision,  get an appointment with a lawyer, have an investigation, schedule a doctor's appointment, schedule a second appointment and also have an abortion. My doctors office right now is scheduling patients 8 weeks out. Getting an attorney can take weeks. So by week 30, he has the documentation and signs away his rights, and she's WAYYY past the point of an abortion. \n\n\n\nAlso, how do you stop a man from lying about it? He swears he's not going to ditch her, swears he's gonna be there, and then once the time for an abortion passes he says \"just kidding I'm out!\". \n\n\n\nSo, there must be a time limit for men too. Let's say it must be 8 weeks before the time for an abortion. Soooo...what's to stop women from waiting to tell men? Purposely only telling men once the time for THEM to financially abortion has passed? \n\n\n\nFinancial abortion is a great fantasy but logistically and practically its borderline impossible to implement in any way that would be \"fair\" and simply trying to fix an unfair situation with another unfair situation is not the answer."
